# ROS STERO Velma
Project made in the Robot Control and Simulation classes, using ROS and C++.
It consisted of one laboratory task and two projects:
- _Laboratory 1_ - ROS node **moving robot's end effector** in a circular motion (with circle's position and orientation as variables)
- _Project 1_ - ROS node controlling the robot to **grab a jar and move it** from one table to another.
- _Project 2_ - ROS node controlling the robot to **open cabinet's door**. 

**World maps** in the projects were created using robot's **kinect sensor**, and all the objects' poses were known, but variable. Robot can be controlled using **impedance control in the joint space or in the operational space**. In the second project, **collision detection** was applied and joints' stiffnes has been manipulated, to get the final results.

Launch files were created and every component was then visualised in **RVIZ** as well as in **GAZEBO**.
